<p>My name is Erika Haan. I am a student at Grand Caynon University. I am studying for a bachelors degree in Cybersecurity. I am from Firestone, Colorado, which is about an <br>
hour north east of Denver. My hobbies are riding and showing horses, watching netflix, and reading.I love spending time with my freinds and I am a huge music girl. I love any <br>
style of music except rap and hard rock. I was in 4-H for 8 years and loved every moment of it. The two horses below are mother and daughter, Jazz(right) and Blondie(left).<br>
I learned to ride on both mares. I also enjoy learning more about programming and cybersecurity.I am especially excited to start practicing defending a server from attacks.</p>

<p> This soundtrack was inspired by my love for action but also drama. There was not a specific artist that influenced this track, but I love the genere of rave music. Would you like to listen?  </p>
